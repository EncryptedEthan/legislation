Welcome to the Manufacturing Departmentâ€™s Quality Assurance guidelines! A brief description regarding the core functions and duties of a Quality Assurance Tester will be displayed below. 

Participants in the QA Team are in charge of testing out updates before their official release, all the while identifying major bugs and forwarding said bugs over to the development team to resolve. A thorough reminder, everything that is mentioned in the communications server, is classified SC-5. Leaking sensitive information will lead to a blacklist from all Foundation platforms, departments, and operations.

The Quality Assurance Team is the first line of defense against any sort of issues that directly affect the games development. Much like what their name says, the general goal during your time here is to maintain the quality of life and gameplay that foundation personnel desire.

As a member of the Manufacturing Department you are given certain special privileges as a reward for work you do.

:::caution
These priveleges are **not a right** - any and all of them can be taken away, for any member at any time. Whilst you will always be able to do what is necessary for your job, abuse of these priveleges will lead to their suspension or removal.
:::

:::note
None of these priveleges may be used on departmental teams (except **Administrative Department, Manufacturing Department** and **Foundation Personnel**). When you are on any other departmental team, you lose rights to  perks given to MaD.

## Developer Console

Any developer who has access to the server side command console may run code as needed, but should be sensible whilst doing this.

- Do **NOT** run code you do not personally understand (or didn't write yourself). This poses a danger to the game.
- Do **NOT** use the command bar to give yourself additional priveleges or bypass the admin guidelines laid out above.
